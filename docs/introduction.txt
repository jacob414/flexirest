`Flexirest` is a project that was born out of the authors long-running
interest for reStructuredText_, and the idea of writing everyday
documents like letters, invoices and other simple documents in this
way.

`Flexirest` tries to strike a middle ground between docutils_ own
command line tool chain (`rst2html` et al), that I find a little to
minimalistic and Sphinx_, that I find very nice but a little heavy to
use for a quickie document like a random letter or some such.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

In short, the goal of `flexirest` is to enable you to use the `reST`
format for everyday documents instead of a word processor or similar
with minimal fuzz. Hence you get to stay in the comfy environment of
your text editor and tool chain. And you can check in your docs *in text
format* into your version control system of choice. And, if used
correctly, you get to reuse a couple of stylings that you only need to
create once.

There are some modestly advanced tricks you can do too, primarily
writing your own `docutils` roles_, but I wouldn't consider those the
major points of flexirest.
